# Task Generation from PRD Workflow

## Overview

This workflow converts Product Requirements Documents (PRDs) into actionable, granular development tasks that can be systematically implemented. The output is a structured task list that breaks down complex features into manageable sub-tasks.

## Process

### Step 1: PRD Analysis

1. Read and analyze the complete PRD
2. Identify all functional requirements
3. Map out dependencies between features
4. Consider technical implementation needs

### Step 2: Task Decomposition

Break down the PRD into logical groups:

#### Core Categories

- **Setup & Infrastructure**: Project setup, dependencies, configuration
- **Data Layer**: Database schema, models, data access
- **Business Logic**: Core functionality, algorithms, processing
- **API/Services**: External integrations, service layers
- **User Interface**: Frontend components, user interactions
- **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, validation
- **Documentation**: Code docs, user guides, deployment notes

#### Task Granularity

- Each task should be completable in 1-4 hours
- Tasks should have clear, measurable outcomes
- Sub-tasks should be specific and actionable
- Include verification steps for each task

### Step 3: Task List Format

Use this markdown structure for consistency:

```markdown
# Task List: [Feature Name]

**Generated from:** `prd-[feature-name].md`
**Target:** Junior Developer
**Estimated Duration:** [X] hours

## Task Categories

### Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] **T001: Project Setup**
  - [ ] Initialize project structure
  - [ ] Configure development environment
  - [ ] Set up version control
  - [ ] Create initial documentation

### Data Layer
- [ ] **T002: Database Schema**
  - [ ] Design database tables
  - [ ] Create migration scripts
  - [ ] Set up data relationships
  - [ ] Add indexes and constraints

### [Additional Categories...]

## Task Dependencies
- T002 depends on T001 (setup complete)
- T003 depends on T002 (data layer ready)
- [Map all dependencies]

## Relevant Files
*To be updated as development progresses*
- `file1.js` - Brief description
- `file2.py` - Brief description
```

### Step 4: User Confirmation

After generating the task list:

1. Present the complete task breakdown
2. Explain the rationale for task grouping
3. Highlight critical dependencies
4. Ask user to confirm before proceeding: "Does this task breakdown look correct? Should we proceed with implementation?"

## Task Writing Guidelines

### Clarity and Specificity

- Use action verbs: "Create", "Implement", "Configure", "Test"
- Include specific deliverables: "Create login form with email/password fields"
- Define success criteria: "Form validates input and displays error messages"
- Specify file locations: "Add validation to `src/utils/validation.js`"

### Technical Considerations

- Account for error handling in each task
- Include logging and monitoring setup
- Consider security implications
- Plan for testing at each stage

### Task Prioritization

1. **Critical Path**: Core functionality that blocks other features
2. **High Priority**: Essential features for MVP
3. **Medium Priority**: Important but not blocking
4. **Low Priority**: Nice-to-have features

## Example Task Template

```markdown
- [ ] **T005: User Authentication**
  - [ ] Create user registration endpoint
    - Input validation for email/password
    - Hash password before storage
    - Return JWT token on success
    - Handle duplicate email errors
  - [ ] Create login endpoint
    - Validate credentials against database
    - Generate and return JWT token
    - Handle invalid credentials
    - Add rate limiting for security
  - [ ] Add authentication middleware
    - Verify JWT tokens on protected routes
    - Return 401 for invalid/expired tokens
    - Add user context to request object
  - [ ] Write unit tests for auth functions
    - Test successful registration/login
    - Test validation errors
    - Test JWT token generation/verification
```

## Integration with GitHub Copilot

### Prompting Strategies

When working with GitHub Copilot on generated tasks:

1. **Context Setting**: Start with "Based on the PRD and current task T00X..."
2. **Specific Requests**: "Generate the user registration endpoint with input validation"
3. **Code Review**: "Review this implementation against the PRD requirements"
4. **Testing**: "Create unit tests for the authentication logic"

### Best Practices

- Reference specific PRD sections in prompts
- Use task IDs in commit messages
- Keep the task list updated with progress
- Mark dependencies as completed before starting dependent tasks

## Quality Assurance

### Task Validation

- Each task should map to specific PRD requirements
- Verify tasks are appropriately sized (1-4 hours)
- Ensure all edge cases are covered
- Check for proper error handling

### Dependency Management

- Identify all task dependencies
- Order tasks logically
- Flag potential blocking issues
- Plan for parallel development where possible

## File Management

### Task List Storage

- Save as `task-list-[feature-name].md` in `/tasks` directory
- Keep task list version controlled
- Update progress regularly
- Archive completed task lists

### Progress Tracking

- Update task status as work progresses
- Add notes about implementation decisions
- Track time spent on each task
- Document any deviations from original plan

## Common Task Patterns

### Frontend Tasks

- Component creation and styling
- State management implementation
- API integration
- User interaction handling
- Responsive design implementation

### Backend Tasks

- API endpoint creation
- Database operations
- Business logic implementation
- Authentication and authorization
- Error handling and validation

### Testing Tasks

- Unit test creation
- Integration test setup
- End-to-end test scenarios
- Performance testing
- Security testing

### DevOps Tasks

- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Deployment configuration
- Monitoring and logging
- Database migrations
- Environment configuration
